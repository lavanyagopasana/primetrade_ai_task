⚙️ Scaling the Frontend–Backend Integration

Move Backend to Cloud

Host FastAPI backend on Render, Railway, or AWS EC2.

Use HTTPS with a domain (e.g., api.primetrade.in).

Use Environment Variables

Store the API base URL in .env for frontend:

VITE_API_URL=https://api.primetrade.in


Use a Production Database

Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL (via Supabase, Neon, or AWS RDS).

Add CORS & HTTPS

In FastAPI, enable CORS for your production domain.

Serve frontend via HTTPS (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

Authentication

Use JWT with short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens.

Store only tokens in HttpOnly cookies or secure storage.

Frontend Optimization

Build React with npm run build → deploy via Vercel or Netlify.

Use lazy loading & caching.
